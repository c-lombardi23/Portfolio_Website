      <h1 class="display-4 mb-4">Hi, I'm Chris</h1>
      <p class="lead text-muted mb-4">
        I’m currently studying Applied Physics and Computer Science, with a strong passion for solving real-world problems through data and intelligent systems.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted mb-3">
        With a background that blends physics, programming, and machine learning, I bring a unique perspective to complex challenges. I’ve worked on diverse projects, from analyzing stellar oscillations in astrophysics research to developing predictive models for fiber-optic cleaving at Thorlabs.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted mb-3">
        I’m especially interested in building machine learning systems that are not just accurate, but also intuitive and grounded in real-world behavior.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        I'm always excited to work on impactful projects that combine physical intuition, smart design, and data. If you're working on something meaningful, let’s connect.
